## jQuery vs Vue.js

jQuery and Vue.js both are great JavaScript libraries. But those two are fundamentally different in terms of their design philosophy.

jQuery is a library specialized for selector operation, it is simple and easy to manipulate DOM. It helps you to ease the imperative programming.

Whereas, Vue.js, is made with a design that uses a **virtual DOM** that runs at high speed. It is suitable **for interactive pages** with declarative programming fashion.

You can incorporate Vue into your project the same way that you would incorporate jQuery, no build step necessary, no Node.js required. Vue is flexible in the sense that we can use it directly in the HTML.
