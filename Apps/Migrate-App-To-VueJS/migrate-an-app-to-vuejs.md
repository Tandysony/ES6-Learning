# Migrate an App to VueJS

> This application is much inspired by this article [Replacing jQuery with Vue](https://www.sitepoint.com/replacing-jquery-vue/). However, jQuery is not used in my application.

In this section, I am going to be building a basic online invoice, in both the declarative programming paradigm and imperative programming paradigm using this (open-source template from Sparksuite)[https://github.com/sparksuite/simple-html-invoice-template].

## Requirements:

- Use this (open-source template from Sparksuite)[https://github.com/sparksuite/simple-html-invoice-template] as a start
- Program in both the declarative programming paradigm and imperative programming paradigm
- User can add change an items information
- Recalculate the prices whenever a user changes the item's unit cost or quantity
- User can add new items
- Shopping cart will display the contents from Local Storage on page loaded
- When a course is removed from the shopping cart, it should be removed also from Local Storage
