# Working with Maps

After youâ€™ve built your Map, you can use the `.has()` method to check if a key-value pair exists in your Map by passing it a key.

```js
const members = new Map();

members.set("Evelyn", 75.68);
members.set("Liam", 20.16);
members.set("Sophia", 0);
members.set("Marcus", 10.25);

console.log(members.has("Xavier"));
console.log(members.has("Marcus"));
```

> **Prints:**  
> `false`  
> `true`

And you can also retrieve values from a Map, by passing a key to the `.get()` method.

```js
console.log(members.get("Evelyn"));
```

> **Prints:**  
> `75.68`
