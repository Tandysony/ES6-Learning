# Browser Compatibilities for ES6 Features

## Code doesn't work in old browsers

The ES6 code is not supported by older browsers. Older browsers that were developed prior to the release of ES6 were developed to support the version of JavaScript at the time (which was ES5.1). If you try running any ES6 code in an older browser, it won't work. For example, trying an arrow function (`=>`) in your code and run it with `IE 11`. There will be an error on the console saying that it doesn't recognize the syntax.

For the ES6/ES2015 specifications, please check [ECMAScriptÂ® 2015 Language Specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html)

## Browser support status

Please check the [ECMAScript Compatibility Table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) built by @kangax for the browser support for ECMAScript features.

Pay attention to the **_first colored column_** in the table, it shows you current browser's supporting status.
